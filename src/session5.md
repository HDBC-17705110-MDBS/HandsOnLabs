# Session 5 - AWS Lambda

In this session we will introduce AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service provided by AWS. We will go through the basics of Lambda, covering how to create a Lambda function, how to configure it and how to trigger it from S3. We will also see how to interact with other AWS services from a Lambda function.

We will also see how to package python dependencies as Lambda Layers and how to make them available to your Lambda function.
