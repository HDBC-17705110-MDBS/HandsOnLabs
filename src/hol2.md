# HOL 02: Deploying a hybrid infrastructure for researchers in AWS

## Introduction

Jupyter Notebooks have become an essential tool for analyzing data and disseminating findings in data science. This hands-on lab guides you through setting up a private Jupyter Notebook server on AWS for your research team. Furthermore, we will deploy a public Nginx web server using Voila to share your team's findings with the public.

## Objectives

This hands-on lab aims to introduce you to the basics of cloud computing by deploying a hybrid infrastructure for researchers in AWS. The infrastructure will include a private Jupyter Notebook server accessible via VPN and a public Voila server accessible from the Internet.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Educate account.
- Access to the AWS Management Console from vocareum.
- Import your public key to AWS EC2 and name it **HOL02**.

## Architecture Diagram

The figure provides a visual representation of the proposed hybrid infrastructure. It depicts a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS, segmented into three subnets: *Production, Research, and DMZ*. The Production Subnet hosts an EC2 instance named **HOL02-VoilaServer**, which is Internet-accessible. The Research Subnet accommodates an EC2 instance named **HOL02-Jupyter**,‚Äù accessible via VPN. The DMZ Subnet contains an EC2 instance named **HOL02-VPN**, which facilitates secure SSH connections from your team to the Research subnet.

  - Name: HOL02-DMZ-SG
    - Description: Security group for DMZ
  - Name: HOL02-Production-SG
    - Description: Security group for Production
  - Name: HOL02-Research-SG
    - Description: Security group for Research

- EC2 Instances:
  - Name: HOL02-VPN
    - Subnet: HOL02-DMZ
    - AMI: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
    - With elastic IP
  - Name: HOL02-VoilaServer
    - Subnet: HOL02-Production
    - AMI: Amazon Linux 2
  - Name: HOL02-Jupyter
    - Subnet: HOL02-Research
    - AMI: Amazon Linux 2

- S3 Buckets:
  - Name: HOL02-Notebooks
    - This bucket must include all the notebooks used by the research team.


## Task

1. Configure all the AWS resources mentioned in the architecture diagram.
2. Create at least on sample Jupyter Notebook named **hol02-app.ipynb** and upload it to the S3 bucket.
3. Configure Jupyter Notebook to be synchronized with an S3 bucket.
4. Configure the Voila server to be sync with hol02-app.ipynb file in the S3 bucket.
5. Explain the steps you took and provide screenshots to illustrate the steps taken in a pdf report.
6. Ensure that:
   - The Voila server is accessible from the public Internet.
   - The Jupyter server is not accessible from the public Internet.
   - The Jupyter server is accessible from the VPN. 

## Deliverables

- A report explaining the steps taken and screenshots to illustrate the steps.  
  - The screenshots should include the configuration of the VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups, and EC2 instances. 
  - Moreover, the report should include the testing you performed, the issues you encountered, and the resolution guidance.

- The report should be submitted:
    - As a PDF file named **HOL02-Report.pdf**.
    - As a public GitHub repository with markdown documentation.

## Hints

### Installing OpenVPN

- Use the following commands to install OpenVPN on the EC2 instance named **HOL02-VPN**:

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install ca-certificates gnupg wget net-tools -y
sudo wget https://as-repository.openvpn.net/as-repo-public.asc -qO /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/as-repo-public.asc
sudo echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/as-repo-public.asc] http://as-repository.openvpn.net/as/debian jammy main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openvpn-as-repo.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openvpn-as -y
```

### Configuring OpenVPN

- After installing OpenVPN, navigate to the public IP of the EC2 instance named **HOL02-VPN** and log in using the username `openvpn` and the password shown in the terminal. The URL should be `https://<elastic-ip>:943/admin`.
- In the OpenVPN web interface, navigate to **Network Settings** and change the hostname to the elastic IP. Then, save the changes and reload the page.
- Log in again. Navigate to VPN Settings and add the subnets CIDR one per line. Then, change the **Should client Internet traffic be routed through the VPN?** to **No**.  Save the changes and reload the page.

### Installing the OpenVPN client

- Follow the instructions in the `https://<elastic-ip>:943/admin` to install the OpenVPN client on your local machine and download the user-locked profile.
- There is no need to configure other users in the OpenVPN server.

### Confgiuring Nginx

- Use the following commands to install Nginx on the EC2 instance named **HOL02-VoilaServer**:

```bash
sudo dnf install nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

To simplify the activity, you can assume that the default page of nginx is the Voila server. 

### Run Jupyter Notebook in the background

- Use the following command to run Jupyter Notebook in the background:

```bash
nohup jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --notebook-dir=/home/ec2-user/notebooks --no-browser > /home/ec2-user/notebooks/jupyter.log  2>&1 &
```

With this command, the Jupyter Notebook will be running in the background and the logs will be saved in the file `jupyter.log`.

### Automate the synchronization with cron

Cron jobs are a powerful tool for scheduling tasks automatically at specific times. For instance, you can schedule your operating system to update every week on Sunday at 0:00.

```bash
echo "0 0 * * 0  sudo yum update -y" | crontab -
```

Explore using cron jobs to synchronize EC2 instances with the S3 bucket.
