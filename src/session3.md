# Session 3 - Introduction to AWS + EC2

During this session we introduced Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. We went through the basics of AWS, covering how to setup your account, access the AWS Dashboard and create an EC2 instance. We also saw how to work on the remote machine through SSH with an example setup based on [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage python environments and deployed a jupyter notebook server that can be accessed from anywhere.

Setting up SSH keys and configuring Security Groups was also covered.

```admonish info
A [guide](./guide1.md) was created to help you set up your AWS account for the first time. The gudie doesn't cover anything thas was not covered during the session, but I suggest you take a look at it if you are having trouble setting up your account and getting all the way through the steps until succesfully connecting to your EC2 instance.
