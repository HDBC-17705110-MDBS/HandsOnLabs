# Guide 1 - Setting up AWS for the first time

Use this guide to **set up AWS for the first time**. If you have already set up AWS and want to work on your project, follow [this guide](./guide2.md).

## Introduction

This guide will help you set up your AWS Academy account so you can work on [Hands-On Lab 2](./hol2.md). If you successfully follow this guide you will end up with:

- Access to the AWS Dashboard
- An SSH key pair on your local machine
- An EC2 instance running with AWS credentials configured
- AWS credentials configured on your local machine
- A terminal on your local machine connected to the EC2 instance

Keep in mind that everytime you want to work with your AWS project and a new session is started, you will need to repeat some of the steps in this guide so try to understand what is being done and why.

So just to make it clear, this guide is intended to be followed only once; the first time you set up your AWS account. The next time you want to work on your project you should follow [this guide](./guide2.md).

If you encounter any issues during the setup, please reach out to me at `ferran.aran@udl.cat`, via Teams message or through the Moodle.
